# Analyze A/B Test Results
In this project, which is part of Udacity graduation requirements, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work on the data provided by the instructor to help a company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
